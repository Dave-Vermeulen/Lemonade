## Write something about something

Hi! I'm Dawud. I live for build things.

I embraced Islam in 1444 just before the month of Ramadan.

A father to a blessing that is always fun to be around.

Self taught developer. Would not recommend, its not for the feint of heart.

Engaged to my best friend.

Running and service to others is my dose of self love.

Connecting with myself, others and Allah SWT.

Currently serving and loving from sunny South Africa.
